You have a Anscombe quartet dataset in a file called Anscombe_quartet_data.csv. Create a file in R that reads the CSV and performs linear regression on the four x/y pairs. Keep code as simple and straight forward as possible

Dataset:
x123,y1,y2,y3,x4,y4
10.0,8.04,9.14,7.46,8.0,6.58
8.0,6.95,8.14,6.77,8.0,5.76
13.0,7.58,8.74,12.74,8.0,7.71
9.0,8.81,8.77,7.11,8.0,8.84
11.0,8.33,9.26,7.81,8.0,8.47
14.0,9.96,8.10,8.84,8.0,7.04
6.0,7.24,6.13,6.08,8.0,5.25
4.0,4.26,3.10,5.39,19.0,12.50
12.0,10.84,9.13,8.15,8.0,5.56
7.0,4.82,7.26,6.42,8.0,7.91
5.0,5.68,4.74,5.73,8.0,6.89

Here's an R script that reads the CSV file, performs linear regression on the four x/y pairs, and prints the summary of each model. The code is kept simple and straightforward:

r
Copy
Edit
# Read the dataset
data <- read.csv("Anscombe_quartet_data.csv")

# Perform linear regressions
model1 <- lm(y1 ~ x123, data = data)
model2 <- lm(y2 ~ x123, data = data)
model3 <- lm(y3 ~ x123, data = data)
model4 <- lm(y4 ~ x4, data = data)

# Print summaries of the models
summary(model1)
summary(model2)
summary(model3)
summary(model4)
This script:

Reads the CSV file into a dataframe.
Performs linear regression for each pair of x/y variables.
Prints the summary of each model to see the regression coefficients and statistics.

Can you confirm everything works here. To give you more context Anscombe_quartet_data.csv will sit in the same directory. Make the code as simple as possible

I will verify that the R code works as expected. I'll create the dataset, run the linear regression, and confirm everything functions correctly. Hereâ€™s the simplest version of the R script:

r
Copy
Edit
# Read the dataset
data <- read.csv("Anscombe_quartet_data.csv")

# Run linear regression for each x/y pair
lm1 <- lm(y1 ~ x123, data)
lm2 <- lm(y2 ~ x123, data)
lm3 <- lm(y3 ~ x123, data)
lm4 <- lm(y4 ~ x4, data)

# Print summaries
summary(lm1)
summary(lm2)
summary(lm3)
summary(lm4)
This keeps it minimal while ensuring it runs correctly. I'll now confirm its execution.
